See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10257) and [project page](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR) for detailed results. In particular, we train the real-world image SR model by using **the first practical degradation model [BSRGAN, ICCV2021](https://github.com/cszn/BSRGAN)**. We also refer to a recent model [Real-ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10833) for better loss function.\n",
